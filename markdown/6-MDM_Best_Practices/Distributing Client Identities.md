# Distributing Client Identities

## Distributing Client Identities
  

Each device must have a unique client identity certificate. You may deliver these certificates as PKCS#12 containers or via SCEP. Using SCEP is recommended because the protocol ensures that the private key for the identity exists only on the device.  

Consult your organizationâ€™s Public Key Infrastructure policy to determine which method is appropriate for your installation.
